**Assumptions**

1. Search History will show latest in search history

- Each Search of the same country/city will update the history and be placed on top

2. Full Search History was intentionally omitted due to time constraint
3. Only current weather is shown (not hourly or 7-day forecast).
4. Search history is stored locally on the device

- Refreshing will result in clear/defaulted state

5. The app UI is English-only.
6. City/Country search is handled via a single input field that accepts `City` or `Country`
7. City/Country search autocomplete was intentionally omitted due to the complexity of sourcing and time constraint.
8. Mobile version was done using Expo Go on physical device ( Iphone 16 )
